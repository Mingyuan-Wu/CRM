# CRM

This is a customer-relationship management system. First I set up a database using MySQL to store customers’ first name, last name, email, and id. Then I designed a webpage that displayed the information of the database. Users can log in to the web page to have access to editing the database. Some of the APIs I implemented include updating or inserting a new entry, deleting an entry, finding and sorting by customers’ Id, etc. I also used Thymeleaf to dynamically render the main web pages.
